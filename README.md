##Overview

The Test Modernization: Training Assessment Framework Navy Assessment Framework (NAF) project is a collaboration between USC ICT; UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST); and USC Rossier to create a web-based, test assessment, framework prototype to support assessments for the Navyâ€™s Sailor 2025 Ready Relevant Learning and High Velocity Learning (HVL) initiatives. These initiatives are making fundamental changes in what is being trained, where training occurs and how it is delivered. These changes make the historical approach of assessing student performance based on final grades inappropriate. Just as RRL is making training more modular, so too assessment must be more modular, and thus, a new assessment framework is needed.

The major purposes of the framework will be 1 to support N1 requirements for validating selection and classification information, e.g., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and Job Opportunities in the Navy. to develop a set of standards and an innovative framework for assessment of Navy training within courses, as well as comprehensive assessments at appropriate points. The ICT, CRESST and Rossier team will build on previous efforts to design a training assessment framework to provide a proof-of-concept assessment approach and comprehensive assessments will be developed for two ratings. Performance assessment prototypes will be validated comparing expert and novice performance, using data analysis and data mining techniques to validate tests.
